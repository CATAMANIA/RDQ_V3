# HTML Best Practices

- Semantic HTML Use appropriate HTML5 semantic elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) to improve accessibility and SEO.

- Accessibility Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable and screen reader-friendly. Use ARIA roles and attributes where necessary.

- Responsive Design Use meta viewport tag for mobile responsiveness and ensure layouts adapt to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.

- Clean and Readable Code Maintain a consistent indentation style (2 or 4 spaces) and use meaningful class and ID names.
